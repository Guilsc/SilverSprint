=============

This project is in active development and not yet ready for general use.  Feel free to subscribe to the repo to track progress or submit pull requests.
Eventually it will be released for OSX (v. 10.7 and up) and Windows (v. 7 and up)

This is a front end for the [opensprints](https://www.opensprints.com) hardware kit.
The software is written in [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/), an opensource library for creative coding. The version of Cinder at the time of coding was 0.8.6 and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/releases/tag/v0.8.6).
