GoldsprintsFx 2.0 (New name pending)
=============

A front end for the [OpenSprints](https://www.opensprints.com) hardware kit.  It allows for the racing of 1 to 4 bikers against each other in a goldsprints style race.  The software is free to use and modify and you're encouraged to hold your own races!

The software is written in [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/), an opensource library for creative coding. The version of Cinder at the time of coding was 0.8.6 and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/releases/tag/v0.8.6).

This project is in active development and not yet ready for general use.  Feel free to subscribe to the repo to track progress or submit pull requests.

Software is for OSX (v. 10.7 and up) and Windows (v. 7 and up)
