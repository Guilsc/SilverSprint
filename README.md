SilverSprint
=============

A front end for the [OpenSprints](https://www.opensprints.com) hardware kit.  It allows for the racing of 1 to 4 bikers against each other in a goldsprints style race.  The software is free to use and modify and you're encouraged to hold your own races!  See _LICENSE_ for more details.

SilverSprint is for OSX (10.7 and up) and Windows (7 and up).

Written in [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/), an opensource C++ library for creative coding.  
The version of Cinder at the time of coding was 0.9.0 [[Download](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/releases/tag/v0.9.0)]

##Setup
1. Clone Cinder 0.9.0 or download via zipped archive. [[Cinder Github](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder)]
2. SilverSprint wants to be in a directory one above the Cinder root. For example:  


```
- Cinder
   - apps  
     - SilverSprint
   - blocks  
   - docs
   - include
   - lib
   - ... 
```
3. Open the project file for your platform. It will be in `SilverSprint/xcode/SilverSprint.xcodeproj` for mac, and `SilverSprint/vs2013` for PC.
4. Build and enjoy. There are no external dependencies aside from Cinder itself.
